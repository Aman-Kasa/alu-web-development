# HTML Structure Project

## Project Overview

In this project, a webpage is to be created based on a designer file provided on Figma. The aim is to construct a clean and semantic HTML structure, focusing solely on markup without the use of CSS or JavaScript. Fundamental HTML concepts are to be applied, and the creation of a well-structured HTML page is the primary goal.

## Learning Objectives

At the conclusion of this project, the following should be understood and explained:

- **HTML (HyperText Markup Language):** The role and importance of HTML in web development should be comprehended.
- **HTML Page Creation:** The process of converting a wireframe design into an HTML page should be grasped.
- **Markup Languages:** The function of markup languages in web development should be understood.
- **DOM (Document Object Model):** Knowledge of the DOM and its role in representing web documents should be acquired.
- **Elements and Tags:** HTML elements and tags should be identified and their functions within webpage structure should be recognized.
- **Attributes:** The use of HTML attributes to provide additional information about elements should be learned.

## Requirements

### General Requirements

- **File Endings:** A newline character should be included at the end of all files.
- **README.md:** A README.md file should be located at the root of the project folder.
- **No External Libraries:** The project must be built using only HTML. The use of external libraries or frameworks (e.g., CSS frameworks, NodeJS, React, or VueJS) is prohibited.
- **W3C Compliance:** All HTML code should be W3C compliant and validated using the W3C Validator.

## Tasks

### 0. HTML Structure

For this task, only the HTML structure should be developed. CSS or JavaScript is not required at this stage. The HTML code should be semantically structured according to the designer's specifications provided in the Figma file.

- **Designer File:** The design details are available in a Figma file. An account on Figma should be created to access these details.
  - **Fonts:** If the necessary fonts are not available on the computer, they can be downloaded from the provided sources: [Source Sans Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro) and [Spin Cycle](https://www.fonts.com/font/linotype/spin-cycle).
  - **Values:** Float values can be rounded as needed.

## Repository Information

- **Repository Name:** alu-web-development
- **Directory:** html_advanced
- **File:** README.md

## Getting started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Figma design file to review the wireframe.
3. Build the HTML structure based on the design specifications.
4. Validate the HTML code using the W3C Validator.
5. Ensure that all files end with a newline and keep the README.md file updated.
